# Airport Runway Management Simulation

C++ project simulating an airport runway using priority queues for Emergency, Landing, and Takeoff requests.

## Features

- Handles emergency landings with priority
- Handles normal landing and takeoff requests
- Displays current queues and served planes
- Simple command-line interface for interaction

## Concepts Used

- C++ structs
- Arrays and pointers
- Basic queue logic
- File-free OOP-style logic

## About Me

This project was done individually as my **PF Lab first semester project**, completely implemented by me. I used my knowledge of queues, arrays, and C++ basics to simulate real-world runway management logic.
